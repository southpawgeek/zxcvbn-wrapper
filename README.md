# zxcvbn-wrapper
## super basic, dependency-less implementation of [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn)

Plain old vanilla JS. **No JS libraries required**, aside from [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) itself. This example is using [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/zxcvbn) to load [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn).

The feedback warnings and suggestions are unmodified. They are hard-coded into [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn).
